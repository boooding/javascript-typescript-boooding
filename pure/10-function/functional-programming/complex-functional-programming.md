命令式编程中函数的作用 ：代码复用、抽象和封装。



## Functional Programming Benefits

### Pure Functions

Pure functions are the functions that return the same output for the given input.

1. Pure Functions Lead to Testable Code
2. Reasonable Code. Having a function with side effects in your code base makes it hard for other developers in your team to read.
3. Pure functions allow us to run the code in parallel. As a pure function is not going to change any of its environments, this means we do not need to worry about synchronizing at all. 
4. Cacheable
